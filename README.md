My VIM dot file, I use vundle plugin manager to manage plugins.
I have following plugins installed:
1. Ultisnips: for code snippets
2. Vim Fugitive: for integrating vim with git
3. Vim Rails: for working with rails projects
4. Vim Airline: for a nice statusbar 

#Desktop settings
=================
I have placed vimrc in dotfiles directory within homefolder
on my laptop and symlinked the file vimrc (without the dot).
The symlink is named .vimrc which points to ~/dotfiles/virmc
